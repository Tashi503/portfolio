   <div class="col-sm-3"><center>I thought spiritual development is the same as religion. Now I know it's different. Religion is the belief we have and spiritual is being the best that we can be in anything. Being a good human. It made me become a better human being and it made me never give up but give my 100% in anything I do.

   <div class="col-sm-3"><center>Till I joined The Royal Academy, I never played Basketball, volley or outdoor sports, but now I play and I am in the School team of football and basketball. Now I play every sport.  My strength and flexibility have improved a lot because of morning physical and programs at The Royal Academy. I have learned many basic health treatments like CPR, RICE and more. I have learned many new indigenous games and I enjoyed playing them.

<div class="col-sm-1"></div>
 <div class="col-sm-4"> I was very poor in controlling my emotions. Like I used to feel angry easily and show out my anger, or when I get sad I take a lot of time to recover from it.  I don't know what to do. I don't know how to balance my emotions, but Emotional Development helped me to control my emotions and balance my emotions. When I feel some negative emotions I try to find the cause and try to solve it and try not to repeat that cause again. I try to use positive emotions. When I become  emotional I play guitar or sports to control my emotions.  Now when I feel something  I realize  what I am feeling and how to control it not fully but some.

   <div class="col-sm-4"><center>In cerebral development I have improved a lot. My creativity, comprehension and analyzing skills have improved a lot.  I just don't learn from teachers but from friends, the internet and books too. I have found various ways to recall my knowledge like through watching Videos or doing quizzes or creating mnemonics. Especially my English has improved a lot after joining TRA. My background is so poor that English for me is really difficult but now I have improved a lot because I started reading books and watching english movies and speaking in English. I started to explore my future career in every subject. I have less knowledge in technology and science and now I know many basics about technology and I learned programming languages python and java. I started creating small websites using html.

<div class="col-sm-2"></div>
   <div class="col-sm-4"><center>My volunteer work in the community has increased a lot and I was able to do more social work. The Royal Academy provided me lots of platforms like community engagements or services where I can help others and build up strong relationships. I learned many new community skills and knowledge from friends and groups. My social relation and skills have improved a lot.
