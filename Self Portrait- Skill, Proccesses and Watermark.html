     <div class="coloumn1 col-sm-4 " style="background-color: #ffbc05; "><center> I have been a confident person before joining the The Royal Academy, but after joining The Royal Academy I learned when to show my confident and when to hold on. I had that problem showing my confident in wrong situation, and I struggled to manage it. Confident in me helped me to learn more and better as I can easily approach others and learn. With help of communication skills, I have learned a lot, and I have also taught a lot. Example: When I have doubts, I can easily approach to my friends or teachers for help. Communication skills of mine help me build a trust between me and other like my juniors. They trust in me and share their problems, and I help them console and help them to settle. Sometimes communication gap brings a problem which communication skills help me to solve the problem. It helps me learn more with a better clarity. My communication skills bring me a lot of friends and helps me become friend with a stranger easily. For example during the treks, I can easily communicate with some stranger and ask for help or way.

     <div class="coloumn2 col-sm-4" style="background-color:#f5ce64;"><center>Before when I used to face problem I directly ask someone to solve for me or help. But now when I face problems, I first identify the problem(what) then Define and Explore by asking the questions where, when, why and who. The I takes action based on the answer on question How can I solve it or face it. And then I look back on the problem and check is it solves now and how can I prevent it from happening again. This skill helps me to face and come over any problem and clears my path of learning journey. Problem solving skills keeps me away from the everyday conflict in life. Not only that it brings me positive attributions about other personâ€™s thought and deeds. It helps me to be a good social person. For example: I got into fights with my friend because my friend didn't give me a time. The because of my problem solving skills it helps me realize that she is helping others and I should be proud for that. <br> <br> <br>

     <div class="coloumn3 col-sm-4" style="background-color:#fae4a7;"><center> If we have good teamwork skills, learning can take more in good and better ways. My teamwork skills make me listen to other ideas and respect their ideas and cooperate with them in the group. And it helps me gain a lot of new knowledge from my group members that I have not knew before. It lets up support each other and trust each other in the group. Trust is the most important thing in our life, and teamwork builds it up too. It gives me a feeling of responsibility for the group and makes me contribute to the group. Lets me share and learn from the group. For example: During Trek, we take self-initiative for works that needed to be done. We understand each other strength and weakness and everyone work on their strength and makes the trek memorable.
